## Usage
### 1. **Register and Create a Project**
   - First, sign up or log in to the [**ErrorSnap**](https://errorsnap.netlify.app) platform.
   - After login create a project with the necessary information.
   - Once created, your project will be listed in the dashboard.

### 2. **Copy Project ID**
   - Click on your created project and copy your project ID.

### 3. **Connect the SDK**
   - To integrate **ErrorSnap** with your web application, you need to include the **ErrorSnap SDK** in your project.
   - Follow the steps in the [SDK Integration Guide](https://github.com/asifurrahaman754/error-snap/blob/main/sdk/README.md) to set up the SDK.

### 4 **Upload Source Maps (Optional but Recommended)**  
   - Install the [**ErrorSnap cli**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/errorsnap-cli) npm package in your project. Use it to automatically upload your source maps, so production apps (like React) can show the original error lines in your dashboard.

     Add the following script to your `package.json` to upload source maps after build:  
     ```json
     "scripts": {
       "postbuild": "errorsnap-upload -p <project_id> -d <dist folder>"
     }
     ```

### 4. **Extra - Slack Integration (Recommended)**
   - We recommend setting up **Slack Integration** to get real-time notifications about errors. This will allow your team to receive instant notifications whenever an error occurs in your project


## Future improvements
- export errors as CSV file
- Show the error function/code pointer
- Supports browsers like uc, brave, opera
